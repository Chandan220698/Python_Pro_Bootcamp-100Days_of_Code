'''
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left
if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
'''

## Solution:
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
year_left = 90 - int(age)
days = year_left*365
weeks = year_left*52
months = year_left*12

print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
