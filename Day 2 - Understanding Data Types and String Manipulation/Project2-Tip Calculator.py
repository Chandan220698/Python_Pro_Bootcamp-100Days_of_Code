'''
If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.
Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.💪

Example Input:
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $124.56
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7

Example Output:
Each person should pay: $19.93

## Solution: 

#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Round the result to 2 decimal places.

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill?"))

tip_as_percent = tip / 100
total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
bill_per_person = total_bill / people
final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)

print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
