  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# Solution
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")                        # Missing quotes
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')    # Quotes mismatch
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')                     # Alignment issue
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")   # Extra bracket
