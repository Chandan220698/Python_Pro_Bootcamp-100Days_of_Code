## Print is used to display the output to console
print("Hello World !")      # " " is used to tell complier that everything inside this is not code but string.
                            # String is sequence of characters. 

# print("Hello World !)     #  This will throw an error as it is missing closing quote ` " `.

print("Hello 1st \nHello 2nd")  # \n is used to print rest of the character in next line
