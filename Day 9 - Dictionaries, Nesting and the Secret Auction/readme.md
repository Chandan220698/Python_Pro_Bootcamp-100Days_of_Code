### Code 1: Dictonaries
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.<br>
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.<br>

> As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.<br>

Syntax:<br>
` {'key': value} `

### Code 2: Nesting
List and dict nested in main dictionary<br>
Example:
```
{
    key1: [list],
    key2: {dict}
}
```
