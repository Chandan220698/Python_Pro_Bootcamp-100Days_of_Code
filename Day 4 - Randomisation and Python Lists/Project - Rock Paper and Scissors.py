# Problem:
'''
Rock Paper Scissors
Instructions
Make a rock, paper, scissors game.

Inside the main.py file, you'll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: rock, paper, and scissors. This will make it easy to print them out to the console.

Start the game by asking the player:

"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."

From there you will need to figure out:

How you will store the user's input.
How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
And also how you will give feedback to the player.

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# Solution:


game_images = [rock, paper, scissors]

user_choice = int(input("What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors.\n"))
print(game_images[user_choice])

computer_choice = random.randint(0, 2)
print("Computer chose:")
print(game_images[computer_choice])

if user_choice >= 3 or user_choice < 0: 
  print("You typed an invalid number, you lose!") 
elif user_choice == 0 and computer_choice == 2:
  print("You win!")
elif computer_choice == 0 and user_choice == 2:
  print("You lose")
elif computer_choice > user_choice:
  print("You lose")
elif user_choice > computer_choice:
  print("You win!")
elif computer_choice == user_choice:
  print("It's a draw")

####### Debugging challenge: #########
#Try running this code and type 5.
#It will give you an IndexError and point to line 32 as the issue.
#But on line 38 we are trying to prevent a crash by detecting
#any numbers great than or equal to 3 or less than 0.
#So what's going on?
#Can you debug the code and fix it?
