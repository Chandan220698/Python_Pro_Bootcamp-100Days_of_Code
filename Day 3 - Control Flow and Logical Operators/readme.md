Learnings: <b>Conditional Statements, Logical Operators, Code Blocks and Scope<b>.<br>
project 3: Treasure Island

### Code 1: Control Flow with Conditional Operators

if/else: Either do this or other thing
```
if condition:
    do this
else:
    do this 
```

eg:
```
if height > 120:
    print("Enjoy your ride")
else:
    print("Sorry! Cant ride")
```
> Note: Python is indentation based. So keep the indent in mind.

### Code 2: Logical Operators

> AND operator : True when all condition is True<br>
> OR operator : True when any of condition is True<br>
> Not operator : Reverse the True to False and vise-versa
